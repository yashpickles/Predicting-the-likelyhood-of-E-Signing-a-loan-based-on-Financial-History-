# Predicting-the-likelyhood-of-E-Signing-a-loan-based-on-Financial-History-
Lending Companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applications, and choosing whether or not the applicant is too risky to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the company then determines the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants, companies can organically recieve them through their website/apps, often with the help of advertisement campaigns. Other times, lending Comapnies partner with Peer-to-Peer(P2P) lending marketplaces, in order to require leads of possible applicants. Some example marketplaces include upstarts, Lending Tree and Lending Club. In this project we are going to assess the quality of the leads our company receives from that marketplace.  Market: The Target audience is the set of loanapplicants who reached out through an intermediatery market.  Product: A Loan  Goal: Develop an model to predict for 'Quality' applicants.  'Quality' Applicants: Are those who reach a key part of the loan application process.
